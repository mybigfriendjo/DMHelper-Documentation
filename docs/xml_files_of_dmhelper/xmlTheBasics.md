# XML - The Basics

At its base XML is a File that has a certain structure that is humanly readable and also readable for DMHelper. Don't worry it won't be long - we just want you to know what we're talking about when using certain terms and you getting a feeling for what you are doing.

Every XML-File starts with this Line:
`<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`
