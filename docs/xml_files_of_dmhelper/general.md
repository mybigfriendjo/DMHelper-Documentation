# General

Most of the information/data within DMHelper - like your campaign file, the DM Screen, the Reference Sheet, etc. - comes from XML-Files.

## What is an XML-File?

If you are totally foreign to XML you might want to familiarize yourself with it with one of the available tutorials out there. We will only cover bare basics in this documentation to get you to a point where you should be able to manipulate the Files of DMHelper.

## What does that mean?

Simple. It means that you can edit certain aspects of the Information that is shown to you within DMHelper.

## Why would I want to do that?

Well, there are multiple reasons. The Files that come with DMHelper are geared towards the standard DnD 5e ruleset. But that might not be what you want to use. You might want to adjust prices or even go a more homebrew route or with a different system altogether. Just a heads-up - we are not yet able to fully support every aspect of other systems. There will be aspects of the File-structures that can't be edited - but we're trying to improve on that. Don't hesitate to give us feedback on that.

## Which Files can be edited?

Theoretically, all of them. That said there are - as mentioned previously - structures that have a hard-coded counterpart within DMHelper and will not be able to be edited, changed, expanded, or reduced. The best way in such cases is honestly just to find out with try and error.
Also there are risks with editing your campaign file directly. It follows a very strict structure and is very extensive depending on what content you have created.Therefore we will concentrate on the files that are more suitable for customization and omit the campaign file altogether.

:::caution

In any case: **Please be careful and backup your files regularly when you are experimenting on them!**

## How do I edit those Files?

While you can use any Text-Editor of your choosing we would suggest using one that "understands" the Syntax (=Structure) of XML and can therefore highlight it for you. Our Suggestion is the Freeware Notepad++ [https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) but you can find heaps of other text editors out there that will support XML. You won't need any expensive features to edit the files on your own.
