# Text Entries

![Text View](./img/textView.png)

A simple text entry useful for recording information, encounter details, campaign notes like party progress, surprising events, spontaneous notes to self or pretty much anything else you need to write down.

If DMH finds the name of another entry in the campaign tree, it automatically converts it into a hyperlink in the text field to allow a quick reference.
