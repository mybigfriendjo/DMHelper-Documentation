# DMHelper Documentation

Thank you so much for using DM Helper!

In the "Introduction to DM Helper" Section we are going to walk you through the application, introduce you to all its components, and give you a basic overview of how these components can help improve your DMing experience!

The Other Sections will expand upon the Details and explain each Feature more in Depth.

A few general Tips:

:::note

In the Documentation you will see the names "DM Helper", "DMHelper" and "DMH" used interchangeably. This has no special meaning and always just refers to the Application.

:::

:::info

While using DMH your cursor will have several modes in which the cursor will operate very differently. Some of these modes do not have unique cursor shapes, and as such can be a bit confusing. If this problem ever occurs you can press the `Esc` key to default your cursor to its original state.
