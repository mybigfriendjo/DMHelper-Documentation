# Text

The 'Text' tab contains basic standard controls for formatting text. It appears both on its own for a text entry and as part of the 'Animation' tab for scrolling text entries in the campaign tree. We are 99% certain that you know how these features work from your favorite word processing tools. If not, congratulations on avoiding computers!

Any formatting changes you make are applied to whatever parts of the text you have selected. Here's a quick overview of what formats you can change in this tab:

- Font - pick any font installed on your system
- Font size - in points
- Font color
- Bold
- Italics
- Alignment: left, centered or right
